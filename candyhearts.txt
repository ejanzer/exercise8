Happy Valentine's Day. May God bless you with his unfailing love.
As busy as we get, we need to be reminded that we are still sweethearts. Valentine's Day is a good day for me to stop and realize how wonderful you make me feel. Happy Valentine's Day.
I cherish the time that we spend together and know that you are a great Valentine.
I like all the ways that we hang out together, even when were mad. And I like the things that are not appropriate for a greeting card.
Whether Valentines Day or not, I can't think of anyone I would rather spend a day with. Happy Valentine's Day.
Be mine. Forever.
Valentines Day is much more fun when I get to spend it with you.
Thank you for letting me have such a wonderful person as my Valentine this year.
I couldn't think of anything better to write in your card than the truth. I love you!
I don't know how to write great messages in cards, but I want to let you know how special you are to me. You are awesome! Happy Valentine's day!
Happy Valentine's Day to the sweetest valentine I could want. You are my sweetheart, and I am glad you're mine.
Our love is like a romance movie, but the best part is that it never ends. Happy Valentine's day!
I worked hard trying to think of what to write in your card, really. Then I just 'googled' it. Happy Valentine's Day.
The only reason I celebrate Valentine's Day is to keep it from turning into sleep-on-the-couch night.
I love you a lot. Especially when you aren't annoying me to death. Happy Valentines Day.
Most people don't know this, but Happy Valentine's Day spelled backwards is Yad Senitnelav Yppah, which means You Stupid Sucker in Cherub language. Cupid told me.
Roses are red, violets are blue, Happy Valentines day, I love this really cool person with a great smile, cool personality, a sense of humor, and it isn't you. Just kidding.
We have many Valentines days under our belts... literally and figuratively. I guess the chocolates add up over time. Happy Valentine's day, and another one under our belts.
I'm wishing you a happy Valentine's day, because it's the only way I'll have a happy Valentine's day.
I can't think of any reasons to not love you.
Don't get any fatter than you already are eating this chocolate.
I hope you like this card.  I got it really cheap cause I bought in bulk.  It turns out I had a lot of Valentines cards to give to all my girlfriends.
I don't want to be your boyfriend any more. Happy Valentine's Day.
I have one wish for Valentine's Day. I want you wrapped up in a big bow.
You are sweeter than chocolate and more beautiful than a rose.
If I tried to write all the things that I like about you in this card, I'd run out of room. Here are a few of my favorite things:
Even though Valentine's day costs a lot more with a girlfriend, you are the one girl in this world who is totally worth it.
There's nothing I'd rather do this Valentine's Day than be with you. There's nothing I'd rather be than your boyfriend.
I am wondering how I got so lucky to have you as a girlfriend.
You deserve to be loved on Valentine's Day. I'll make sure you get what you deserve.
I'm glad you have me as your boyfriend, because now I know you'll be loved the way you should be this Valentine's Day.
You are the best gift I could ever ask to have for Valentine's Day!
I am lucky to have a girlfriend who is beautiful, fun, smart, and crazy enough to go out with me.
Valentine’s Day makes me stop to realize how awesome it is to be going out with you.
I’m happy to be your Valentine, but I'm not as happy as I am to have you as my Girlfriend every day.
Your hair flows like beautiful ocean waves
I love to listen to the rhythm of your breath
Time flashes by when I spend it with you
I live a dream as I hold you close in my arms
If I could find a card that said exactly what I want to say to you, it would say.
Valentine's Day is all about love. I love you because
Since it's Valentine's Day, I get a chance to tell you all the things I should tell you more often
Valentine's Day is special for us because
This is a mushy and romantic holiday, but I don't mind because
I love having you as a friend!
Having a supportive friend like you makes me feel special on any day of the year, not just on Valentine's Day.
Thanks for being my friend and my Valentine this year!
Sending warm feelings to a great friend this Valentine's Day.
I want to let you know that I admire you for all of your many positive qualities, I love you despite your faults, and I am grateful to have you as my friend.
You are my Valentine's Day ally. It's nice to have a good friend like you on my team.
I just want to say thank you for being such a great friend for such a long time. Your loyalty is unfailing.
Valentine's day is a great day to let those you love know how special they are. I want to let you know that you are a special friend.
May you feel a wealth of love this Valentine's Day.
I feel loved this Valentine's Day knowing that I have you as a friend.
You're my best friend and my best Valentine!
All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt.
We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another.
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light.
Valentine's Day can be a special day
When someone really cares about you
So Valentine's Day is more than ok
Since you're my friend and I'm yours too.

A friend is someone you can count on
To tell you what you need to hear
A friend can give encouraging words
To help you get over your fears.

Friends will stay right by your side
Even when others give up on you
Friends can laugh when you screw up
But you'll be laughing along too.

Valentine’s Day is for you and me
Our very own holiday to celebrate
There’s no one else I’d rather be
Than your special Valentine date.

Even though this is a special day
And Nothing feels different to me now
I’m glad you’re my Valentine today
You can ALWAYS make me say wow!

It’s the way that you look at me
It’s the way that you kiss my cheek
It’s the amazing way I feel with you
That keeps every day feeling new.

Your beauty can't be done justice with my words
I can't describe how your smile colors my world
Or the way you float gracefully like a bird
I want you to know that you are a special girl.

You are more than just a Valentine's Day date
I love to spend time with you as much as I can
You look me in the eyes and I just can't wait
When it comes to kissing you, I'm your biggest fan.

Your mom is the first to love you
When you are still a little baby
And there’s a lot you sill can't do
But I can show her she’s special
By explaining my point of view.

Even though we are apart
You are my special Valentine 
Your voice warms my heart
I’m so glad that you’re mine.

Friends need love on Valentines Day
Because they are special people too
There are so many things I could say
To say thanks for all the things you do.

There’s one very important rule
That your Valentine’s Day is cool
With cards and candy at school
No one has to feel like a fool.

If staying married to you the rest of my life is crazy, then I don't want to be sane.
Anniversaries are a reminder that you have to keep falling in love with the same person year after year to make the marriage work.
Anniversaries give us a reason to treat each other like we aren't married anymore. We are just dating on our anniversary.
Some say love is complicated, but love is simple. It's the people involved that cause the problems.
Husbands should treat their wives like girlfriends and wives should treat their husbands like boyfriends on their anniversary. Then you'll want to get married again, but won't have to go through the trouble.
No one ever gets a promotion out of the titles of husband and wife, but it is possible to be fired.
Love is a four letter word, just like the others.
Love is a short word for something long lasting. Infatuation is a long word for something that is temporary.

The reason they're called the opposite sex is because every time you think you have your wife fooled-it's just the opposite.

If our wives don't treat us like they should, we ought to be very grateful.
No man prospers without the consent and cooperation of his wife.
A husband is one who stands by you in troubles you wouldn't have had if you hadn't married him.
It makes a wife shudder to think what bad habits her husband might acquire if he did not smoke, drink, and swear.
My husband will never chase another woman. He's too fine, too decent, too old.

Happy Valentine's day to the supremely special sweetheart of my life! Your love completes me like a cherry completes the perfect sundae! Have an ultra-sweet day and I lovvvvve you!
Happy Valentine's Day to the most special person in my life. You are my love, my heart and my joy.
You make my heart feel as light and carefree as a butterfly floating through the air on a sweet spring day. I cherish the gift of love that we have been given, and the happiness you provide. Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine's Day to my one and only. Thank you for everything you've done for me throughout the years and for all the happiness you brought in my life!
Locks are never made without a matching key. Luckily for me, you came into this world with the key that unlocks my heart. It's safe to say that we're meant to be. Happy Valentine's Day!
Without you there would be no me. It's as simple as that! I love you with all my heart. Happy Valentine's Day baby!
You've always been my sunshine on a cloudy day, my shoulder to cry on and a helpful hand when I needed you. You deserve this special day as a reminder of the impact you've made on my life.
We're very different in many things we do in life, but we do have one very important thing in common, our profound and true love for each other. Happy Valentine's Day!
You fill my life with a sense of warmth and bliss, and I cannot imagine a day without looking into your eyes, holding your hand, or kissing your lips. Happy Valentine's Day to the center of my universe.
I prayed for God to send me someone truly amazing. He heard my prayer, and I am so thankful that He chose to send you. Happy Valentine's Day - you are truly heaven sent.
There's nothing better than spending this day with the person I care about the most. Happy Valentine's Day!
Love is the glue that holds us together and keeps us smiling every day of the year. On this beautiful day, we celebrate this love of a lifetime. Happy Valentine's Day.
You've given me the most wonderful and joyful years of my life and for I will be always thankful. Happy Valentine's Day!
My life with you is like an endless romantic movie. I'm indeed the luckiest person on Earth! I love you with all my heart. Happy Valentine's Day!
I love you more with each day. I can see you even when my eyes are closed and I can feel our love deep within my heart. I love you with every ounce of my being. Happy Valentine's Day to my one true love.
Happy Valentine's Day baby. Thank you for showing me everyday what true love is all about. I'll love you always and forever!
Happy Valentines' Day to the person who has managed to make me smile every single day we've been together. I love you!
Today we celebrate Valentine's Day, a day full of romanticism and love. With you, however, it's Valentine's Day every day! I love you! Happy Valentine's Day baby!
My love for you gives me joy and pure happiness and I never thought I could ever be so lucky. Happy Valentine's Day baby!
The day we met, I looked into your eyes and I immediately knew that you were going to be my sweet Valentine for life! Happy Valentine's Day my love!
A message for my Sweetheart. Everyday with you is Valentine's Day for me. I Love You.

A day without you is a day without sun, a night without you is a night without moon; a life without you is a life without life.
As busy as we get, we need to be reminded that we are still sweethearts. Valentine's Day is a good day for me to stop and realize how wonderful you make me feel. Happy Valentine's Day.
Cupid shoots well for me! He hit you and me with perfect aim.
Curved high on a mountain, covered deep in dew, I saw these words… I LOVE YOU!
Even though Valentine's day costs a lot more with a girlfriend, you are the one girl in this world who is totally worth it.

Every moment I am not without you, my tears fill the ocean blue…By mine, my love, forever.
Every time I see you, I feel a little flame in my heart, that lights up, because… I LOVE YOU!
Falling in love is like looking at the stars. If you pick one out of the billions and stare at it long enough all the others will melt away.
For today or tomorrow, be mine, forever and ever and ever.
God has created you only for me, because he knows no one can love you more than me!
Happy Valentine's Day to the sweetest valentine I could want. You are my sweetheart, and I am glad you're mine.

I have one wish for Valentine's Day. I want you wrapped up in a big bow.
I have seen angels in the sky, I have seen snowfall in July, I have seen stars falling apart, but I haven't seen anyone like you.
I like all the ways that we hang out together, even when were mad. And I like the things that are not appropriate for a greeting card.
I love loving you. Happy Valentine's day!
I love my life because it gave me you. I love you because you are my life.
I love you today, I love you tomorrow, and I love you forever…till I die…
I loved you then and I love you now. But I am least bothered as I can't imagine doing anything else.
I loved you when the sun set yesterday, I love you when the moon comes tonight and I will love when the sun rises tomorrow.
I may not say always how special you are for me, I may not reach to you because I am busy, but you are someone I really love and care for.
I need you like a butterfly needs its wings, an ice bear needs cold weather and a soul needs a body.
I pray to God for a thousand lives, and I wish I get you in each of them.
I thank god because he made me meet you in the journey of life.

I will hold on you forever because I have never known someone more special than you.
I will wait for you till dawn even if it is the darkest night.
I wish God gives me birth hundred times only to be your lover forever.
I wish to die before you, so that I can write your name on each star. Let the world see you mean the world to me.
I would have been incomplete without your love; it's you who makes me whole.
I’m happy to be your Valentine, but not as happy as I am to have you as my Girlfriend every day.
If I had to choose whether to breathe or to love you, I would use my last breath to tell you that… I love you.

It is love when we think about each other every single moment despite being miles apart. We resides in each other's heart.
It's a long day but I know I will be fine with your touching care, Be there when I come back because I feel so lost when you are not around.
Last night I matched every star with a reason for loving you. I ran out of stars because my love is countless.
Let these words touch your eyes, let these feelings touch your soul; let this love touch your heart.
Life without your love is like a tree without any fruit.
Like everybody who is not in love, he thought one chose the person to be loved after endless deliberations and on the basis of particular qualities or advantages. 
Love is a state of mind which has nothing to do with the mind. 
Love is sweet when it is new and sweeter when it is true and sweetest when it is with you, you seduce me, so I'm falling into you can't you see.
Love one another and you will be happy. It's as simple and as difficult as that. 
Loving you is like breathing-so essential and important to remain alive.
Loving you is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

Our love is like a romance movie, but the best part is that it never ends. Happy Valentine's day!
Small things that you do makes my heart fill with joys.
Sometimes I laugh even when there is no around thinking about all the funny things that you do just to make me happy. Love you for being there always.
Thank you for letting me have such a wonderful person as my Valentine this year.
The first time you touched me, I felt love and even now the feeling of anxiety and excitement remains the same when you come close to me. The love for you grows with every passing moment.
The greatest tragedy of life is not that men perish,but that they cease to love.
The reassuring smile on your lips, touch of your hands, and the little ways in which you make me happy is what keeps me alive everyday.
The way you look at me when I sit in front of the mirror… your smile when I catch you unaware noticing me… these small things show how much you love me more than any words can express.
The way you wake me up and hold me in your arms every morning makes for a great start of my day, and I know you will always make me feel this special no matter how much we grow old.
There's nothing I'd rather do this Valentine's Day than be with you. There's nothing I'd rather be than your boyfriend.
Think of my love like a diamond ring, – precious, rare and gorgeous, that glorifies your life forever.
Thousands may come in your life and thousands may go, but there will be one person on earth who can give away life for you-and that's me!
Times have changed but your love has remained the same since the time we have been dating. I love you so much.
True love is difficult to find, great to have, easy to lose, but hard to forget, I love you forever.
Valentine’s Day makes me stop to realize how awesome it is to be going out with you.
Valentine's Day is much more fun when I get to spend it with you.
We picture love as heart-shaped because we do not know the shape of the soul.
When I die. I want to go to heaven, to put your name on a star. Let all the angels see, how much you mean to me.
When I think of you, Roses of red grow in my heart. Every time I see you smile, they bloom and make me happy.
When you come to me with your hair all messed up, I love you. When you come to me with chocolate all over your lips, I love you. When you crack silly jokes with me, I love you. I love you because you join me in my weirdness. Thanks for being my silly soul mate. Love you forever!
Whether Valentine's Day or not, I can't think of anyone I would rather spend a day with. Happy Valentine's Day.
Who says we are miles apart? I still see you as I close my eyes.
Without your love I can do nothing, with your love there is nothing I can't do.
You always know exactly how I feel and you are always there to make me feel alright when I stay far away from you… It is love that keep the connection between us so strong.
You are as warm as sunshine. As sweet as sugar, as beautiful as flower, as pure as my love for you-I love you!
You are my destination in life, also the way to reach to it. Wish to spend this lovely journey with you.
You are my first thought when I wake up; you are my last thought when I fall asleep.
You are not mine, but still I don't know why I am afraid of losing you.
You are sweeter than chocolate and more beautiful than a rose.
You are the best gift I could ever ask to have for Valentine's Day!
You are the sun in my days, the moon in my nights, the waves in my ocean, and the life in my life.
You deserve to be loved on Valentine's Day. I'll make sure you get what you deserve.
You might mean to be a no one for the world, but for someone, you mean the whole world.
Your eyes lit up my world, your smile brightened my sky.
Your love help me find happiness in the most unexpected ways… life with you has been sheer bliss.
Your love lightens up my path and shows me the way to move forward.
Your love makes my life stronger and happier. Be mine forever.
It's sexy time!
You make my bed rock.
I bet you look good naked.
I lost my number, can I have yours?
I couldn't decide what to get you for Valentine's day, so I thought I'd just get you naked.
You turn me on.
If you were my homework, I'd do you every night.
Let's commit the perfect crime... I'll steal your heart and you steal mine.
Happy Valentine’s Day, Sweetheart.
Happy Valentine’s Day with love and sprinkles on top!
The happiest of heart days to the sweetest of Valentines!
Happy Valentine’s Day, gorgeous.
Wishing the sweetest, happiest day to my forever Valentine.
Happy Valentine’s Day to my one and only.
You have no idea how sexy you are.
You inspire me to be a better person.
You take my breath away.
It's so great to be married to my best friend.
With love that will just keep growing
I love when you snuggle me and make me laugh. I don't know which I like best.
Saving up all my kisses until we’re together again.
Hope your day is filled with fun and your mouth is filled with chocolate!
Hugs and kisses.
Kisses.
XOXOXO.
